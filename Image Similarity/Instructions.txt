Important Notes:
    1) Make sure all the Libraries are preinstalled in your Laptop
    2) Keep all the files in the same folder
    3) Keep all the images in the a same folder you want to test and then keep that folder in the same folder wher all the other files are            kept.
    4). Get used to jupyter Notebook a little bit. You should know the basics of operarting it.
    
Steps to follow:

1).

Goto Terminal and type jupyter notebook

2).

Goto the folder where all the files are kept

3).

There will be 4 files:
Instruction manual, raw_code.ipynb, bullet_fire_arm.pkl and functions.py

4).

raw_code.ipynb contain the complete code of how the Model is made. You can edit it according to your convinience but it is better if it is left untouched.It is for understanding purpose.

5).

For making Predictions:

Open a new ipython Notebook,

Import all the folowing Libraries:

from zipfile import ZipFile
import os
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.image as mpimg
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout,BatchNormalization, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D,Input  # Layers to be used in CNN(Keras) Model
from keras.optimizers import RMSprop

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical


6).
Write the following code in the next_line

from sklearn.externals import joblib 
model = joblib.load('bullet_firearm.pkl')  // Your model will be loaded in the Notebook

7).
Write the following code in the next_line

from functions import load_images

address = './name_of_the_folder_in_which_all_the_images_are_kept/.'

images,names = load_images(address) // This will convert the images into a format which the model understands.

8).
Copy the following code in the next_line

    predictions = model.predict(data)
    max_value = np.argmax(predictions,axis = 1)
    final_answer = []
    for i in range(len(max_value)):
        if max_value[i] == 0:
            final_answer.append(11)
        elif max_value[i] == 1:
            final_answer.append(12)
        elif max_value[i] == 2:
            final_answer.append(21)
        elif max_value[i] == 3:
            final_answer.append(22)
        elif max_value[i] == 4:
            final_answer.append(31)
        else:
            final_answer.append(32)
            
9). All the Predictions are done from the range(0 to 5):

0 : FireArm 1 bullet 1 a11
1 : FireArm 1 bullet 2 a12
2 : FireArm 2 bullet 1 a21
3 : FireArm 2 bullet 2 a22
4 : FireArm 3 bullet 1 a31
5 : FireArm 3 bullet 2 a32

10). final_answer is a list of integers from 0 to 5
